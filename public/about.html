<p>I always aspired to be a full stack web developer, even though i knew it was hard i didn't give up.<br>
  I think so that persistent determination is the reason that who i am in the present now.<br>
  I designed this whole website as it will act as a symbol of introducing about me<br>
   and my progress to a large amount of people without any struggle.</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies include reading books which enrich me always. I'm ready to improve forever.<br>
   I also do enjoy watching anime and movies. I also play videogames to relax myself.<br>
   I am kind of optimistic and I do belive to never give up and<br>
  its never late to start something.I am open to learn anything from anyone. Especially in this growing world<br>
   with rapid technologies around us everywhere, I'm delighted to learn any of the new languages that arise in the<br> 
   field of Web development. </p>
